# swapi-wars
My very own integration of the famous swapi endpoint.

# what is it
It is just a simple visual representation of all the entities that the https://swapi.dev endpoint provides.

# how does it work
It is a TypeScript based NextJS application that uses server side rendering combined with axios to connect to the endpoint itself and tanstack tables to display said data.

# how can I start it
To start it locally you have install all the npm packages and then just run it either with `npm run dev` or if you want the production version first call `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`
